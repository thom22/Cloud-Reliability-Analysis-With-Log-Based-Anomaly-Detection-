# Cloud-Reliability-Analysis-With-Log-Based-Anomaly-Detection-

 
This project, Cloud Reliability Analysis with Log-Based Anomaly Detection, focuses on improving cloud system reliability by automatically detecting abnormal patterns in system logs using AI and machine learning techniques. The work builds upon the use of large-scale distributed system logs, specifically the HDFS dataset from LogHub, to identify anomalies that may indicate system faults or performance degradation. The project combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, and both supervised and unsupervised modeling approaches to detect unusual behaviors within system components. It also includes a prototype monitoring dashboard built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to visualize real-time anomalies and reliability metrics such as Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR). The end goal is to demonstrate how AI-based anomaly detection can enhance reliability monitoring and operational visibility in modern cloud environments.
